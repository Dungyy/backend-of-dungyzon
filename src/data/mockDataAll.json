This caused it to be a vending machine of sorts, pulling change out of my pocket every time I withdrew it. It also ran supremely hot and the battery life declined miserably over time after using it a lot as a hot spot. I've only had this \"top of the line\" iphone for about a week now, but it's already a lot better than my previous phone. I took a chance on Boost Infinite because they use three different towers to collect signals from (tmobile, AT&T, & Dish) which theoretically gives my phone better reception. IT DOES. My previous phone rarely captured 5G signals, and it's much more frequent with Boost. My bosses iphone, which only uses AT&T almost never has 5G when I have 5G. I haven't used the phone as a hot spot yet, so I cannot comment on how hot the phone gets on heavy load, but it's already cooler under normal operation. It's probably not fair to compare battery life of a new phone over a less than two year old phone, but already better than I can remember with the other flagship alternative. I somehow got this iphone 15 Pro Max for $60/mo on amazon. That deal no longer exists and it will be about $6 more under current offerings by Boost Infinite. Comparatively, T-Mobile is offering this phone at an upgrade price of $50/mo....JUST FOR THE PHONE! This plan through BOOST INFINITE also gives me a new phone EVERY YEAR! I have no regrets whatsoever. Even at current deals it's a bargain.",

        "review": "*Updated Review 11/03/2023*Boost customer service has been more than helpful. It took about a week to start seeing improvements within their network. I missed a call from a Tech at Boost today, and I received a text message. They stated their name and said they have been making changes on their end to improve their service, and asked for my feedback. I was honest and said that I have noticed a HUGE difference. The call quality and overall service has improved drastically. I also let them know that I still have some random call drops in certain areas. The Tech assured that they were going to continue working to improve overall experience. Like I said in my original review, they are going through some growing pains with their new \"America's Smart Network.\" My only complaint now is that everything cannot be accessed through their website. If you want to view your account and pay your bill, it has to be done through their app on your phone. In conclusion, it is a bit of headache at first, but their outstanding customer service has made it well worth it.*Original Review*Boost Infinite’s network is not good if you travel a lot, or want to have a call that doesn’t sound like you are talking through a Walkie Talkie. The company is owned by Dish Network and is going through its growing pains. There are 3 types of eSIMs that can be assigned to the iPhone 15 through Boost. The most likely eSIM you will receive is the Dish Network eSIM that switches between all the partnered networks; AT&T, T-Mobile, and Dish. The Dish eSIM, which connects you to \"America's Smart Network,\" is what I received. Note that it is random to which one of the 3 eSIMs you can get. Coverage is great, but if you are traveling away from home, you will drop your calls constantly if you talk on the phone a lot while driving, as it switches to different towers. Regardless, my biggest complaint is the awful call quality, which you cannot get away from; even on Wi-Fi calling. I can say their customer support agents are very friendly, which is the only thing keeping me from switching so far. I have been patient, and will wait a bit longer to see if it gets better before I switch back to Verizon.",

The Apple watch app on the iPhone says it is not supported and Boost also say Apple Watch is not supported at this time but I was able to pair my watch and it works just fine on WiFi, it just doesn't support cell service on Apple Watch. So if you currently have an Apple Watch with cellular, you will need to turn off your cell plan because it doesn't work. Bummer - I can't go running with my watch and take calls or map my runs unless I carry my phone too. Otherwise a great deal, I'm sure they will enable cell service on watches in a month or two.",

        "review": "They botched the first attempt at activation. Deleting my account in the process and telling there was no solution except to send the phone Back to Amazon! Amazon redirected me to a team inside Boost Infinite that could help and my phone was activated. all good, right?NO!! - Boost actually still has the old account so I have two. And they are sending me email telling me if i don't activate this phone, I will be charged full price. WTH?!? When I asked them to delete the zombie account, they said. \"Well, you have to send the phone back to Amazon, repurchase the package and then we can set up the new phone. Ummm ... no! My phone is loaded up, working great, and I am paying my Boost Infinite monthly bills.HELP ME, ANYONE!!!!!And Amazon, please head over to Boost Infinite and light a fire under them. I wasted 10 hours with their nonsense and ridiculous protocols. At my rates, that enough income to by 3 phones full price.",
